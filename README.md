# Offline Handwritten Mathematical Expression Evaluator Using Convolutional Neural Network

A machine learning based project to segment, recognise and evaluate Handwritten Mathematical Expression (HME) from an image (which may contain single or multiple arithmetic and linear equations).
The recognition of segmented symbols is done using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on an augmented EMNIST and custom built dataset giving an accuracy of 97% in recognising the symbols correctly.
Written into a research paper accepted in the ICICC Conference (International Conference on Innovative Computing and Communication) 2020 to be published by the Springer AISC series.
